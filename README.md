# Python Concepts Practice Repository

This repository contains Python code that I have practiced and learned from various sources. While some of the code may have been inspired or learned from external resources, I have also made an effort to implement the concepts independently to reinforce my understanding. The code in this repository covers a range of Python topics and concepts that I have studied.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of this repository is to serve as a learning and practice resource for Python programming. By working on these exercises and projects, I aim to solidify my understanding of different Python concepts and improve my coding skills.

## Topics Covered

The repository covers a wide range of Python concepts, including but not limited to:

- Variables and Data Types
- Strings
- Control Structures (If-else, Loops)
- Functions and Modules
- Recursions
- Object-Oriented Programming (Classes, Inheritance, Encapsulation, Polymorphism)
- File Handling
- Exception Handling
- List, Tuple, Set, and Dictionary data structures
- Functional Programming (Lambda)

## Folder Structure

The repository is organized into different directories, each focusing on a specific concept or topic.
